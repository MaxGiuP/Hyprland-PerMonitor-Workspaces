# Hyprland-PerMonitor-Workspaces
Hyprland script to have dynamic workspaces per monitor.

Does 2 things:
  1. Renames workspaces on each monitor to be in chronological order. 
  2. Shifts windows down to fill empty workspace IDs.

To use effectively, rebind workspace selection keys to be relative to the monitor using m~[number] as targets instead of just a number.
